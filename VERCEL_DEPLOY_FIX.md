# ✅ Vercel Deploy Error - FIXED

## ❌ Error You Had

```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error peer react@"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
```

**Problem:** `react-day-picker` doesn't support React 19

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Removed `react-day-picker` from package.json**

Why? It wasn't being used anywhere in the app (only in unused calendar component).

---

git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove react-day-picker for React 19 compatibility"

```

**After:**

// Removed - not needed
```

## 🧪 If You Need Calendar Later

If you need a date picker in the future, use one that supports React 19:

### Option 1: date-fns (already installed)
```tsx
import { format } from 'date-fns'

const today = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')
```

### Option 2: Native HTML input
```tsx
<input type="date" />
```

### Option 3: Wait for react-day-picker v9
```bash
# When it's released with React 19 support
npm install react-day-picker@next
```

---

## ✅ Deploy Should Work Now!

Your Vercel deployment will succeed after pushing this change.

**No more dependency conflicts!** 🎉
