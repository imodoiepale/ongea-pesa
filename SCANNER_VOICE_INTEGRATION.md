## 🎙️ Voice Integration

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Uses browser's built-in Web Speech API
- Clear voice at 1.1x speed
- Cancels previous speech before new message
- Fallback to basic messages if API fails

### Future: ElevenLabs Integration
To use ElevenLabs voice instead of browser TTS:

1. Get ElevenLabs API key
2. Update `sendScanDataToVoice` to call ElevenLabs API
3. Stream audio response
4. More natural, multilingual voices (Swahili, Sheng)

---

## 📊 Balance Tracking

### How Balance is Fetched:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchBalance = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/balance')
    const data = await response.json()
    setBalance(data.balance || 0)
  }
  fetchBalance()
}, [])
```

### Balance is Sent with Scan:
```typescript
await fetch('/api/voice/send-scan-data', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    scanResult: result,
    balance: balance  // ✅ Always included
  })
})
```

---

## 🔄 Real-time Updates

Balance should update in real-time when transactions complete:
- Already implemented in voice-interface.tsx
- Uses Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Scanner can subscribe to same channel for live balance updates

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Flow:
1. Navigate to Payment Scanner
2. Console should show: `Balance loaded: 15000`
3. Scan any payment document (paybill, till, etc.)
4. Listen for voice message with details + balance
5. Verify all extracted details are correct
6. Confirm or cancel payment

### Test Different Types:
- ✅ Paybill numbers
- ✅ Till numbers
- ✅ QR codes
- ✅ Receipts
- ✅ Bank slips
- ✅ Pochi la Biashara

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### If API Fails:
- Falls back to basic audio message
- Still speaks extracted details
- Console shows error for debugging

### If Balance Not Loaded:
- Defaults to 0
- Still proceeds with scanning
- User should refresh if balance stuck at 0

### If Confidence Low:
- Voice message indicates confidence level
- User can decide whether to proceed
- Option to rescan for better accuracy

---

## 🎨 UI Indicators

Scanner shows:
- **Balance badge** at top (KSh 15,000)
- **Confidence score** in scan results
- **Speaking indicator** when AI is talking
- **Processing state** during Gemini analysis

---

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Hands-free**: Voice tells you everything
2. **Informed decisions**: Balance always visible
3. **Fast**: Auto-scan + voice = 2-3 seconds
4. **Accurate**: Gemini Vision + confidence scores
5. **Multilingual**: Ready for Swahili/Sheng voices

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
- [ ] Replace browser TTS with ElevenLabs
- [ ] Add Swahili and Sheng voice responses
- [ ] Real-time balance updates in scanner
- [ ] Voice confirmation ("Say yes to proceed")
- [ ] Transaction history voice playback

---

**Integration complete!** The scanner now speaks extracted details with balance on every scan. 🎉
