# Real-Time Balance Validation System

## Overview

The system now validates balance **before** transactions reach n8n or the database, providing immediate feedback to the ElevenLabs AI agent.

## How It Works

```
User speaks ‚Üí ElevenLabs AI ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Balance Check ‚Üí n8n/Database
                                            ‚Üì
                                    ‚ùå Insufficient Funds?
                                            ‚Üì
                                    Return to AI Agent
                                            ‚Üì
                                    AI speaks error message
```

## Implementation

### 1. Voice Webhook (`/api/voice/webhook/route.ts`)

The webhook now performs these checks **in real-time**:

#### Step 1: Fetch Current Balance
```typescript
// Get user's current wallet balance from database
const { data: balanceData } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('wallet_balance')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single()

const currentBalance = parseFloat(balanceData.wallet_balance) || 0
```

#### Step 2: Validate Amount
```typescript
const requestedAmount = parseFloat(body.amount)

// Check if amount is valid
if (isNaN(requestedAmount) || requestedAmount <= 0) {
  return error: "Invalid amount"
}

// Check if amount exceeds maximum
if (requestedAmount > 999999) {
  return error: "Amount too large"
}
```

#### Step 3: Check Balance for Debit Transactions
```typescript
const debitTypes = [
  'send_phone', 'paybill', 'withdraw', 
  'buy_goods_till', 'buy_goods_pochi',
  'bank_to_mpesa', 'mpesa_to_bank'
]

if (debitTypes.includes(transactionType)) {
  if (currentBalance < requestedAmount) {
    const shortfall = requestedAmount - currentBalance
    
    return {
      success: false,
      error: 'Insufficient funds',
      current_balance: currentBalance,
      required_amount: requestedAmount,
      shortfall: shortfall,
      agent_message: "I'm sorry, but you don't have enough funds..."
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Only Proceed if All Checks Pass
```typescript
// If we reach here, all validations passed
// Forward to n8n for processing
await fetch(N8N_WEBHOOK_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(transaction)
})
```

## Error Responses

The webhook returns structured error responses that the AI agent can understand:

### Insufficient Funds Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Insufficient funds",
  "message": "Your current balance is KSh 14,630, but you're trying to send KSh 116,000. You need KSh 101,370 more.",
  "current_balance": 14630,
  "required_amount": 116000,
  "shortfall": 101370,
  "agent_message": "I'm sorry, but you don't have enough funds for this transaction. Your current balance is 14,630 shillings, but you're trying to send 116,000 shillings. You need 101,370 shillings more. Would you like to add funds to your wallet first?"
}
```

### Invalid Amount Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid amount",
  "message": "The amount -500 is not valid. Please provide a positive number.",
  "current_balance": 14630,
  "agent_message": "I'm sorry, but the amount you provided is invalid. Please try again with a valid amount."
}
```

### Amount Too Large Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Amount too large",
  "message": "The amount KSh 1,500,000 exceeds the maximum of KSh 999,999.",
  "current_balance": 14630,
  "agent_message": "I'm sorry, but the amount of 1,500,000 shillings exceeds our maximum transaction limit of 999,999 shillings. Please try a smaller amount."
}
```

## ElevenLabs AI Agent Configuration

Update your ElevenLabs agent to handle error responses:

### Agent System Prompt Addition

```
When you receive an error response from the transaction webhook:
1. Check if response.success is false
2. Read the agent_message field
3. Speak the agent_message to the user naturally
4. Offer alternatives (e.g., "Would you like to add funds first?")

Example error handling:
- Insufficient funds ‚Üí Suggest adding money to wallet
- Invalid amount ‚Üí Ask user to provide a valid amount
- Amount too large ‚Üí Suggest splitting into smaller transactions
```

### Tool Configuration

In your ElevenLabs tool configuration, add error handling:

```json
{
  "name": "send_money",
  "description": "Send money via M-Pesa",
  "url": "https://ongeapesa.vercel.app/api/voice/webhook",
  "method": "POST",
  "error_handling": {
    "on_400": "Read agent_message field and speak it to user",
    "on_500": "Say: I'm sorry, there was a technical issue. Please try again."
  }
}
```
