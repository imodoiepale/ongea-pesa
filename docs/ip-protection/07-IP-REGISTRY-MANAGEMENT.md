## 💰 IP Valuation

### Why Value IP?

**Purposes:**
- **Investment:** Show IP value to investors
- **Acquisition:** Determine company valuation
- **Licensing:** Set royalty rates
- **Financial Reporting:** Balance sheet asset
- **Insurance:** IP insurance coverage
- **Tax:** Transfer pricing, R&D credits

### Valuation Methods

#### **1. Cost Approach**

**Method:** Sum of costs to create IP

**Calculation:**
```
IP Value = Development Costs + Registration Costs + Maintenance Costs

Example (Ongea Pesa Mobile App):
Development: KES 5,000,000 (developer salaries, 6 months)
Registration: KES 10,000 (copyright, trademarks)
Maintenance: KES 500,000 (annual updates)
TOTAL: KES 5,510,000 (~USD 45,000)
```

**Pros:** Simple, objective  
**Cons:** Doesn't reflect market value or future earnings

---

#### **2. Market Approach**

**Method:** Compare to similar IP sales/licenses

**Example:**
> Similar fintech app sold for USD 500,000
> Adjust for differences (features, users, revenue)
> Estimated value: USD 300,000-500,000

**Pros:** Market-based  
**Cons:** Hard to find comparable transactions

---

#### **3. Income Approach**

**Method:** Present value of future income from IP

**Calculation:**
```
IP Value = Σ (Future Cash Flows / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year)

Example (Ongea Pesa Patent):
Year 1 revenue from patent: KES 10M
Year 2: KES 15M
Year 3: KES 20M
...
Discount rate: 15%
NPV: KES 80M (~USD 650,000)
```

**Pros:** Reflects earning potential  
**Cons:** Requires revenue projections (uncertain)

---

### Ongea Pesa IP Valuation (Estimated)

| Asset | Valuation Method | Estimated Value (USD) |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Trademarks** | Cost + Market | 50,000 |
| **Software Copyright** | Cost | 100,000 |
| **Patents** | Income (projected) | 200,000 |
| **Trade Secrets** | Income (customer data, algorithms) | 500,000 |
| **Domain Names** | Market | 10,000 |
| **TOTAL IP PORTFOLIO** | | **860,000** |

**Note:** Valuation increases with:
- Revenue growth
- User base expansion
- Market validation
- Patent grants
- International protection

**Recommendation:** Conduct professional IP valuation when:
- Raising Series A+ investment
- Considering acquisition offers
- Licensing IP to third parties
