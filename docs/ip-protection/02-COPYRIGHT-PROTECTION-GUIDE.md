## 📚 Introduction to Copyright

### What is Copyright?

**Copyright** is a legal right that grants creators exclusive control over the use and distribution of their original creative works. Copyright arises **automatically** upon creation and fixation in a tangible form.

**Legal Framework in Kenya:**
- **Copyright Act, 2001** (as amended)
- **Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO)** - regulatory authority
- **Berne Convention** - international copyright treaty (Kenya is a signatory)

### Key Principles

1. **Automatic Protection:** Copyright exists from the moment of creation
2. **No Registration Required:** Registration is optional but recommended
3. **Exclusive Rights:** Only copyright owner can reproduce, distribute, adapt, or publicly perform the work
4. **Duration:** Life of author + 50 years (for literary/artistic works); 50 years from creation (for software)
5. **Territorial:** Copyright is recognized internationally through treaties

### Why Register Copyright?

While copyright is automatic, **registration with KECOBO provides:**

✅ **Legal Advantages:**
- Prima facie evidence of ownership in court
- Easier enforcement against infringers
- Stronger legal standing in disputes
- Public record of ownership

✅ **Commercial Benefits:**
- Facilitates licensing and assignments
- Increases investor confidence
- Supports IP valuation
- Enables statutory damages in infringement cases

✅ **Practical Benefits:**
- Deters potential infringers
- Simplifies due diligence
- Provides official documentation
- Low cost (KES 1,000 per work)

## 👥 Copyright Ownership and Assignment

### Work Made for Hire

**Default Rule (Kenya Copyright Act):**
> "Where a work is made by an employee in the course of employment, the employer is the first owner of copyright."

**For Ongea Pesa:**
- ✅ Code written by **employees** = Ongea Pesa owns copyright
- ⚠️ Code written by **contractors** = Contractor owns copyright (unless assigned)

**Best Practice:**
- Include copyright assignment clause in **all employment contracts**
- Require copyright assignment from **all contractors**
- Document ownership clearly

---

### Copyright Assignment

**When Needed:**
- Hiring freelance developers
- Purchasing code from third parties
- Acquiring another company's IP
- Receiving contributions from non-employees

**Assignment Agreement Must Include:**
1. Clear identification of work
2. Statement of assignment ("hereby assigns all copyright...")
3. Scope (worldwide, perpetual, exclusive)
4. Consideration (payment, equity, etc.)
5. Warranties (assignor owns rights, no infringement)
6. Signatures of both parties

**Sample Assignment Clause:**
```
The Contractor hereby irrevocably assigns to Ongea Pesa Limited all 
right, title, and interest in and to the copyright in the Work, 
including all derivative works, throughout the world, for the full 
term of copyright protection, including all renewals and extensions.
```

**Recording Assignment:**
- File assignment with KECOBO (optional but recommended)
- Form: Copyright Assignment Form
- Fee: KES 2,000
- Provides public record of ownership transfer

---

### Joint Ownership

**Arises When:**
- Multiple authors contribute to single work
- No clear agreement on ownership
- Collaborative development

**Implications:**
- Each co-owner can use work independently
- Cannot license without other owners' consent
- Difficult to enforce or commercialize

**⚠️ Avoid Joint Ownership:**
- Use work-for-hire or assignment agreements
- Clearly designate single owner (Ongea Pesa)
- If joint ownership unavoidable, draft detailed co-ownership agreement
