### Types of Trademarks

## 🇰🇪 Kenya Trademark Registration Process

### Overview

**Governing Law:** Trade Marks Act (Cap. 506)  
**Regulatory Body:** Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI)  
**System:** First-to-file (not first-to-use)  
**Duration:** 10 years, renewable indefinitely

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Step 1: Preliminary Trademark Search (TM27)**

**Purpose:** Check if your proposed mark conflicts with existing registrations

**Process:**
1. Visit KIPI eCitizen portal: [https://kipi.ecitizen.go.ke](https://kipi.ecitizen.go.ke)
2. Select "Trademark Search (TM27)"
3. Enter proposed mark details
4. Select relevant Nice class(es)
5. Pay search fee
6. Receive search report (3-5 business days)

**Cost:**
- Local applicant: KES 1,000 per class
- Foreign applicant: USD 50 per class

**What to Look For:**
- Identical marks in same class
- Similar marks in same/related classes
- Phonetically similar marks
- Visually similar marks
- Conceptually similar marks

**⚠️ Important:** A clear search doesn't guarantee registration, but reduces rejection risk.

---

#### **Step 2: Choose Nice Classification**

Trademarks are registered per class of goods/services. Kenya uses the **Nice Classification** system (45 classes total).

**Recommended Classes for Ongea Pesa:**

| Class | Description | Ongea Pesa Application |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Class 9** | Computer software, mobile applications, downloadable software | ✅ **Critical** - Mobile app, software platform |

| **Class 35** | Advertising, business management, data processing | 🟡 Medium Priority - Marketing services |

## 🌍 International Trademark Protection

### Why International Protection?

Ongea Pesa may expand beyond Kenya to:

**Key Principle:** Trademarks are **territorial** - Kenyan registration only protects in Kenya.

### International Filing Options

#### **Option 1: Madrid Protocol (Recommended for Multiple Countries)**

**What is Madrid Protocol?**
- International treaty administered by WIPO
- File ONE application to protect in 130+ countries
- Manage all registrations through single system

**How It Works:**
1. Must have **base application/registration** in Kenya (home country)
2. File **International Application (MM2)** via KIPI
3. Designate countries where you want protection
4. WIPO examines and forwards to designated countries
5. Each country examines under local law
6. If approved, protection equivalent to national registration

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Cost-effective for multiple countries
- ✅ Single application in English
- ✅ Centralized management
- ✅ Easy to add countries later
- ✅ Renewal through single process

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Dependent on base application for 5 years ("central attack")

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Choosing Descriptive Marks**
❌ **Bad:** "Fast Payment App"  
✅ **Good:** "Ongea Pesa" (distinctive, invented)

**Why:** Descriptive marks are weak and hard to register

---

### 2. **Skipping Preliminary Search**
❌ **Mistake:** Filing without TM27 search  
✅ **Best Practice:** Always search first

**Why:** Saves money if mark is already taken

---

### 3. **Wrong Nice Class**
❌ **Mistake:** Filing in Class 35 (advertising) instead of Class 36 (financial services)  
✅ **Best Practice:** Research correct classes carefully

**Why:** Wrong class = no protection for actual business

---

### 4. **Vague Specification**
❌ **Bad:** "Computer services"  
✅ **Good:** "Mobile payment processing services; electronic funds transfer; digital wallet services"

**Why:** Vague = examiner objections + weak protection

---

### 5. **Inconsistent Branding**
❌ **Mistake:** Registering "Ongea Pesa" but using "OngeaPesa" or "ONGEA PESA"  
✅ **Best Practice:** Use mark exactly as registered

**Why:** Inconsistent use = weak enforcement

---

### 6. **Ignoring Deadlines**
❌ **Mistake:** Missing 60-day response deadline  
✅ **Best Practice:** Set multiple calendar reminders

**Why:** Missed deadline = application abandoned

---

### 7. **Not Monitoring Journal**
❌ **Mistake:** Unaware of competitor's similar application  
✅ **Best Practice:** Monitor IP Journal monthly

**Why:** Miss opposition window = competitor gets registration

---

### 8. **Forgetting Renewal**
❌ **Mistake:** Missing 10-year renewal  
✅ **Best Practice:** Set renewal reminders 18 months in advance

**Why:** Lapsed registration = loss of all rights

---

### 9. **Using Before Registration**
⚠️ **Risk:** Using ® symbol before registration  
✅ **Correct:** Use ™ until registered, then ®

**Why:** False claim of registration = legal penalties

---

### 10. **DIY Complex Cases**
❌ **Mistake:** Handling opposition/objection without attorney  
✅ **Best Practice:** Engage trademark attorney for complex matters

**Why:** Legal expertise increases success rate
