## 🛡️ Patent Maintenance and Enforcement

### Annual Maintenance Fees

**Requirement:** Pay annual fees to keep patent in force

**Kenya Patent:**
- Due date: Anniversary of filing date
- Grace period: 6 months (with late fee)
- Late fee: 50% surcharge
- If not paid: Patent lapses (cannot be restored)

**Payment Process:**
1. KIPI sends renewal reminder (usually 3 months before)
2. Pay via eCitizen portal or bank
3. Receive payment receipt
4. Patent remains in force

**⚠️ Critical:** Set calendar reminders! Missing payment = loss of patent rights.

**Fee Schedule:** See cost table above (increases over time)

### Patent Enforcement

**Exclusive Rights:**

As patent owner, you can prevent others from:
- ❌ Making the invention
- ❌ Using the invention
- ❌ Selling the invention
- ❌ Importing the invention
- ❌ Offering to sell the invention

**Without your permission** in Kenya (or designated ARIPO countries)

### Infringement Actions

**If Someone Infringes Your Patent:**

**1. Cease and Desist Letter**
- Send formal demand to stop
- Reference patent number and claims
- Demand compliance within 14-30 days
- Cost: KES 20,000-50,000

**2. Negotiated License**
- Offer to license patent to infringer
- Collect royalties instead of suing
- Cost: Negotiable

**3. Court Action (High Court)**
- File patent infringement suit
- Seek:
  - Injunction (stop infringement)
  - Damages (compensation)
  - Account of profits
  - Delivery up of infringing products
- Cost: KES 500,000 - 2,000,000+
- Timeline: 2-4 years

**Remedies:**
- **Injunction:** Court order to stop infringement
- **Damages:** Compensation for losses
- **Account of Profits:** Infringer pays profits made

### Defenses to Infringement

**Infringer May Argue:**
- Patent is invalid (lack of novelty, inventive step)
- Their product doesn't fall within claims
- Prior use (used invention before your filing date)
- Exhaustion (bought patented product legitimately)

**⚠️ Risk:** Court may invalidate your patent if defenses succeed

### Patent Licensing

**Generate Revenue from Patent:**

**Exclusive License:**
- Only licensee can use invention
- You cannot use or license to others
- Higher royalty rates

**Non-Exclusive License:**
- Multiple licensees allowed
- You retain right to use
- Lower royalty rates

**License Terms:**
- Royalty: % of sales or fixed fee
- Territory: Kenya, Africa, worldwide
- Duration: Term of patent or shorter
- Field of use: Specific applications

**Example Royalty Rates (Fintech):**
- 2-5% of gross revenue
- Or fixed fee: USD 10,000-100,000/year
