# ⚡ RESTART REQUIRED - Changes Not Applied Yet

## ❌ Current State

Your Next.js server is still running the **old code** with test data.

The changes are saved but **not compiled yet**.

## ✅ FIX: Restart Next.js Server

### Step 1: Stop the Server

In your Next.js terminal:
```bash
Press Ctrl + C
```

Wait until you see the server has stopped.

### Step 2: Restart the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
✓ Ready in 2s
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Verify Changes Loaded

You should see in the compile:
```
✓ Compiled /api/voice/webhook/route in XXXms
```

## 🧪 Test Again

1. Say: **"Send 100 to 0712345678"**

2. **Watch your Next.js terminal** for these NEW logs:

```
=== VOICE WEBHOOK CALLED ===
⚠️ No user context found, fetching most recent user from database
✅ Using most recent user: your@email.com

📤 Final user data for n8n:
  user_id: real-uuid-here
  user_email: your@email.com
  user_phone: 254712345678
```

**If you DON'T see these logs**, the old code is still running.

## ❓ Still Showing Test Data?

### Check 1: Did You Restart?
```bash
# Terminal should show:
npm run dev
✓ Ready in 2s
```

### Check 2: Are You Logged In?

Go to `localhost:3000/login` and login with your email.

This creates your account in the database so the fallback can find you.

### Check 3: Check Your Console Logs

**If you see:**
```
⚠️ No user context found, fetching most recent user from database
❌ Failed to fetch fallback user: [error]
```

**Then:** There's an issue with `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()`

**Fix:** Check your Supabase service role key in environment variables.

### Check 4: Do You Have a User in Supabase?

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT id, email, last_sign_in_at 
FROM auth.users 
ORDER BY last_sign_in_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**If NO results:** You need to create an account first at `localhost:3000/login`

## 🎯 Expected After Restart

### Your Next.js Logs:
```
=== VOICE WEBHOOK CALLED ===
✅ Using most recent user: ijepale@gmail.com
📤 Final user data for n8n:
  user_id: b8c5a1f0-4d8e-4abc-9123-456789abcdef
  user_email: ijepale@gmail.com
```

### Your n8n Execution Logs:
```json
{
  "user_id": "b8c5a1f0-4d8e-4abc-9123-456789abcdef",  ✅
  "user_email": "ijepale@gmail.com",  ✅
  "amount": 3000
}
```
