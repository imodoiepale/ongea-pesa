## 📦 What Was Removed

### 1. react-day-picker
- **Why removed:** Doesn't support React 19
- **Was it used?** No - only in unused calendar component
- **Impact:** None - not needed in app

### 2. vaul
- **Why removed:** Doesn't support React 19  
- **Was it used?** No - we use custom BalanceSheet component
- **Impact:** None - drawer.tsx component unused

---

## ✅ What Still Works

All features intact:
- ✅ Voice interface
- ✅ Balance management
- ✅ Transaction history
