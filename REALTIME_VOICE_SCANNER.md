# 🔴 Real-Time Voice + Scanner Integration

## ✅ How It Works Now

Your scanner now works like a **live stream** with ElevenLabs - the AI has immediate access to scanned data during your conversation!

### 🎯 Real-Time Flow

```
1. User scans payment document
   ↓ (instant)
2. Gemini extracts payment details
   ↓ (instant)
3. Data sent to ElevenLabs conversation context
   ↓ (instant - no DB delay!)
4. ElevenLabs AI can see and respond immediately
   ↓
5. You can talk about the scanned data naturally
```

## 🚀 What Changed

### ❌ **REMOVED**: Database Storage
- No more `scan_context` table needed
- No database writes slowing things down
- No need to query DB for context

### ✅ **ADDED**: Direct Conversation Context
- Scan data sent directly to ElevenLabs conversation
- Available immediately in the active session
- AI can reference it as you talk

---

## 💬 How to Use It

### Example Conversation:

**You**: *[Scan a till number sticker]*

**Scanner**: "Till number detected! 832909 for SuperMart. Amount KSh 1200. Your balance is KSh 15,000. Confidence 98%."

**You**: "Hey Ongea, what did I just scan?"

**ElevenLabs AI**: "You just scanned till number 832909 for SuperMart. The amount is 1,200 shillings. Your current balance is 15,000 shillings, so you have enough to complete this payment. Would you like me to proceed?"

**You**: "Yes, pay it"

**ElevenLabs AI**: "Processing payment of 1,200 shillings to till 832909..."

## 🎙️ Natural Conversations

The AI understands context from your scans:

### Scenario 1: Multiple Scans
```
You: [Scan paybill]
AI: "Paybill 888880 detected, account 123456..."

You: [Scan another till]
AI: "Till 456789 detected..."

You: "Pay the first one"
AI: "Paying paybill 888880, account 123456..."
```

### Scenario 2: Questions About Scans
```
You: [Scan receipt]
AI: "Receipt from Java House, 850 shillings..."

You: "What was the date?"
AI: "The receipt is dated October 14, 2025."

You: "Save it under food expenses"
AI: "Receipt saved to food category."
```

### Scenario 3: Comparisons
```
You: [Scan till 1]
AI: "Till 123456, amount 500 shillings..."

You: [Scan till 2]
AI: "Till 789012, amount 800 shillings..."

You: "Which one is cheaper?"
AI: "The first till at 500 shillings is cheaper by 300 shillings."
```

## 🔴 LIVE Session Context

### What ElevenLabs Sees:
```json
{
  "contextMessage": "PAYMENT SCANNED: Till number detected! 832909 for SuperMart. Amount KSh 1200. Your balance is KSh 15,000. Confidence 98%. Should I proceed with this payment?"
}
```

### How It's Sent:
```typescript
// Direct to conversation context
if (conversation.addContext) {
  conversation.addContext(data.contextMessage);
  console.log('✅ Context added to live conversation');
}
```

### Result:
- ✅ **Instant availability** - No delay
- ✅ **Session-based** - Only during active conversation
- ✅ **Natural flow** - Talk about it like it's in front of you
- ✅ **No database** - Faster and simpler

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Zero Latency**
- No database writes
- Direct memory context
- Instant AI access

### 2. **Session Awareness**
- AI knows what you scanned THIS session
- Can reference multiple scans
- Understands temporal context ("the first one", "that till")

### 3. **Natural Language**
- "What did I scan?"
- "Pay that"
- "How much was it?"
- "Is my balance enough?"

### 4. **Multi-Scan Support**
- Scan multiple documents
- AI tracks all of them
- Can compare and choose

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Single Scan + Question
1. Open scanner
2. Scan a till number
3. Say: "Hey Ongea, what till number did I scan?"
4. AI should respond with the exact till number

### Test 2: Multiple Scans
1. Scan paybill
2. Scan till
3. Say: "Hey Ongea, pay the paybill"
4. AI should pay the paybill (not the till)

### Test 3: Balance Check
1. Scan payment with amount
2. Say: "Hey Ongea, do I have enough balance?"
3. AI should compare amount vs balance

## 📊 Console Logs

Watch for these logs to confirm it's working:

```
📡 Sending scan data to voice AI in REAL-TIME
✅ Scan data formatted: Till number detected! 832909...
🔴 LIVE: Sending to ElevenLabs conversation context
✅ Context added to live conversation
✅ REAL-TIME: ElevenLabs has access to scan data NOW
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`app/api/voice/send-scan-data/route.ts`**
   - Removed database storage
   - Returns `contextMessage` for ElevenLabs
   - No webhook calls

2. **`components/ongea-pesa/payment-scanner.tsx`**
   - Added `conversation` from ElevenLabs context
   - Sends data directly to conversation
   - Real-time context injection

### How Context is Added:
```typescript
// In scanner component
const { conversation } = useElevenLabs();

// When scan completes
if (conversation.addContext) {
  conversation.addContext(`PAYMENT SCANNED: ${message}`);
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Keep Session Active**
- ElevenLabs must be connected
- Check for green "ElevenLabs AI Active" indicator
- If disconnected, reconnect before scanning

### 2. **Scan First, Ask Later**
- Scan all documents you need
- Then talk to AI about them
- AI has full context of everything scanned

### 3. **Use Natural Language**
- Don't say exact numbers
- Say "that one", "the first", "the cheaper one"
- AI understands references

### 4. **Check Console**
- Look for "REAL-TIME" logs
- Confirms data reached ElevenLabs
- Debug if not seeing logs

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### AI Doesn't Know What I Scanned?

**Check:**
1. Is ElevenLabs connected? (purple indicator)
2. Did you see "✅ Context added to live conversation"?
3. Is the conversation still active?

**Fix:**
- Reconnect ElevenLabs
- Scan again
- Check browser console for errors

### Scan Data Not Showing?

**Check:**
1. Did Gemini extract data? (check confidence score)
2. Is `/api/voice/send-scan-data` being called?
3. Is the response successful?

**Fix:**
- Verify Gemini API key in `.env.local`
- Check network tab for API calls
- Rescan with better lighting
